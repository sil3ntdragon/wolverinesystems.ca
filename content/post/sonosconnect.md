New toy! Got myself a Sonos Connect for the home. I really do need to start integrating my growing list of IoT systems. I'll have to draw up my plans and write down my experiences and methods as soon as the home is done renovating. My hopes is to have my younger daughters participate in the development. 'hope they love it!
